"Create an ethical and secure policy for the Cabinet Office to utilize Large Language Models (LLMs), focusing on not processing data above the 'OFFICIAL' classification level or any Personally Identifiable Information (PII). The policy should detail how LLMs could provide advice and support, with a clear emphasis on the roles and responsibilities of the security team in its development, agreement, and enforcement."

b) Suggestions:

Clearly state the steps to ensure that LLMs do not process 'OFFICIAL' level data or PII.
Explain how LLMs can provide advice and support in the context of the Cabinet Office.
Discuss how to manage potential risks and conflicts that may arise during the policy's implementation.
Describe the anticipated improvements or changes in the Cabinet Office's operation with the deployment of LLMs.
